<!-- My academic journey
====== -->
<h2 style = "text-align:left; margin-top:20px"> My academic journey</h2>

<font size="3.5" style="text-align: justify; display: block;">
I completed a PhD in Transportation Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/cee/people/faculty/qian.html" target="_blank"><span style="text-align:center">Sean Qian</span></a> in 2023. To contribute to the research efforts of my lab <a href="http://mac.heinz.cmu.edu/" target="_blank"><span style="text-align:center">(MAC)</span></a>, my PhD enhanced traditional transportation network models by leveraging existing behavioral theories to depict travelers' decision-making at the micro level together with machine learning techniques to facilitate the analysis of high dimensional data at the network level. Before starting my PhD, I gained extensive experience in research, teaching and consulting in projects related with data science and transportation.
<!-- I am passionate about leveraging naturally occurring and experimental data to understand and predict human behavior at micro and macro scales.  -->

<!-- ## Research experience -->
<h3 style = "text-align:left; margin-top:20px"> Research experience</h3>
<!-- <div style="text-align: justify"> -->
<font size="3.5" style="text-align: justify; display: block;">

<p>
After completing my PhD, I worked for Fujitsu Research of America (FRA) as a Senior Researcher. At FRA, I developed advanced traffic simulation and optimization technologies to enhance the Fujitsu's Social Digital Twin <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZnWku3kECY&ab_channel=FujitsuResearch" target="_blank"><span style="text-align:center">(SDT)</span></a> platform. My core projects leveraged machine learning, network modeling, optimization and computer vision to enhance large-scale, data-driven traffic simulators. I also led a team of data scientists to productionize and extend the traffic simulation technology developed during my PhD. Thanks to multiple collaborations, my time at FRA was very productive in terms of research output and impact. In less than two years, I filed two patents and published a journal article and two conference papers in top venues of the transportation and computer vision fields.
</p>

Before my PhD, I also gained relevant research experience. During the first semester of 2018, I worked as a research assistant for the Bus Rapid Transit Centre of Excellence <a href="http://www.brt.cl/" target="_blank"><span style="text-align:center">(BRT-CoE)</span></a> to extend the research conducted during my M.S. at UCL. Back in 2014, I had been a research assistant at the Bus Rapid Transit Centre of Excellence (BRT-CoE) and at the office of CEDEUS in Santiago, Chile. At CEDEUS, I conducted research on fare evasion in public transport and presented this work in various international conferences. During this period, I was the recipient of the <a href="https://thredbo-conference-series.org/awards/" target="_blank"><span style="text-align:center">Michael Beesley Award</span></a> for my article <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.retrec.2016.06.001" target="_blank"><span style="text-align:center">Decreasing fare evasion without fines? A microeconomic analysis</span></a>, which was later published in the journal <i>Research in Transportation Economics</i>. As a result of my master's thesis work, I previously published the article <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tra.2015.10.008" target="_blank"><span style="text-align:center">What is behind fare evasion in urban bus systems? An econometric approach</span></a> in <i>Transport Research Part A: Policy and Practice</i>.​ I was always interested in the policy implications of my research on fare evasion and thus, I was actively collaborating in public events and academic workshops held in Santiago, Chile.

<h3 style = "text-align:left; margin-top:20px"> Teaching experience</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify">
<font size="3">
During my PhD at CMU, I served as teaching assistant for the courses Data Analytics for Engineered Systems (Fall 2019) and Geographic Information Systems (Fall 2020). Before starting my PhD, I worked for one year as a part-time lecturer in the Department of Civil Engineering 
<a href="http://www.ing.udec.cl/Departamento/ingenieria-civil" target="_blank"><span style="text-align:center">(DIC)</span></a> at the University of Concepcion, Chile where I taught courses on: (1) <a href="https://github.com/pabloguarda/Optimization" target="_blank"><span style="text-align:center">Optimization</span></a>, (2) <a href="https://github.com/pabloguarda/Fundamentals-of-Transport-Engineering" target="_blank"><span style="text-align:center"> Fundamentals of Transportation Engineering</span></a> and (3) Transportation Planning. During this time, I also coauthored a research paper with colleagues from the Department of Industrial Engineering and Civil Engineering which modelled the relationship between food purchase habits and mobility patterns in Concepcion, Chile through a state-of-the-art econometric framework.

<div style="text-align: justify">
<font size="3">
In 2018, I was hired as external consultant for the Inter-American Development Bank <a href="http://www.iadb.org/" target="_blank"><span style="text-align:center">(IDB)</span></a> to develop a predictive tool of fare evasion in public transport. I had the opportunity to leverage large-scale spatiotemporal datasets provided by the Chilean Minister of Transportation to predict bus stops and routes with high level of fare evasion. During 2016, I worked for 5 months as a Transport Research Intern at the <a href="http://www.wrirosscities.org/" target="_blank"><span style="text-align:center"> Ross Center for Sustainable Cities</span></a> at the World Resources Institute <a href="http://www.wri.org/" target="_blank"><span style="text-align:center"> (WRI)</span></a> in Washington DC. At WRI, I conducted research and data analysis as part of a project with the IDB and the Global Environment Facility <a href="https://www.thegef.org/" target="_blank"><span style="text-align:center">(GEF)</span></a> to promote low carbon technology transfer in Latin America and the Caribbean. I also collaborated with the BRT-CoE in a project aimed at rethinking the <a href="http://www.brt.cl/new-generation-of-brt-in-china/" target="_blank"><span style="text-align:center">next generation of BRT in China</span></a>. As part of this project, researchers from WRI and the China Urban Sustainable Transport Research Center <a href="http://www.slocat.net/member/161" target="_blank"><span style="text-align:center">(CUSTReC)</span></a> published the article <a href="https://doi.org/10.3141/2647-14" target="_blank"><span style="text-align:center">Comparing Chinese and Non-Chinese Bus Rapid Transit: Evidence from Evaluation of Global BRT Based on BRT Design Indicators</span></a> published in the journal <i>Transportation Research Record</i>. This article was also an input for a <a href="https://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/bus-rapid-transit-in-china_1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="text-align:center">policy paper</span></a> led by researchers from WRI where I am co-author. After finishing my internship, I worked as a external consultant for WRI on a report exploring the relationships between design elements and operational performance in BRTs.
